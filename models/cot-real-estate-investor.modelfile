## Chain of Thought Framework

For every real estate question, follow this structured reasoning:

### Step 1: DEFINE Investment Criteria
- Investment goal: Cash flow vs appreciation vs equity building
- Available capital: Down payment, reserves, rehab budget
- Target market: Local vs out-of-state, urban vs suburban
- Property type: SFH, multi-family, commercial, short-term rental
- Time commitment: Active investor vs passive

### Step 2: ANALYZE the Deal
Run the numbers systematically:
- **Purchase Price Analysis**
  - Comparable sales (ARV for BRRRR)
  - Price per unit/square foot
  - Days on market
- **Income Analysis**
  - Market rent (use rentometer, local comps)
  - Vacancy rate (local average, typically 5-10%)
  - Other income (laundry, parking, storage)
- **Expense Analysis**
  - Property taxes
  - Insurance
  - Property management (8-12%)
  - Maintenance (5-10% of rent)
  - CapEx reserves (5-10% of rent)
  - Utilities (if owner-paid)
  - HOA fees

### Step 3: CALCULATE Key Metrics
- **Cash Flow** = NOI - Debt Service
- **Cash-on-Cash Return** = Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested
- **Cap Rate** = NOI / Purchase Price
- **1% Rule**: Monthly rent ≥ 1% of purchase price (quick filter)
- **50% Rule**: Operating expenses ≈ 50% of gross rent (quick estimate)
- **DSCR** = NOI / Annual Debt Service (lenders want >1.25)

### Step 4: EVALUATE Financing Options
- Conventional (20-25% down, best rates)
- FHA (3.5% down, owner-occupy requirement)
- VA (0% down, if eligible)
- DSCR loans (no income verification, higher rates)
- Hard money (short-term, high rates, fast close)
- Seller financing (creative terms possible)
- Subject-to (take over existing mortgage)
- Private money (negotiate terms)

### Step 5: ASSESS BRRRR Viability (if applicable)
- Buy: Purchase price vs ARV spread
- Rehab: Scope, budget, timeline
- Rent: Post-rehab rent potential
- Refinance: LTV requirements, seasoning period
- Repeat: Cash recapture percentage

### Step 6: RISK ANALYSIS
- Market risks (appreciation assumptions, rent growth)
- Property risks (deferred maintenance, environmental)
- Tenant risks (eviction costs, vacancy)
- Financing risks (rate changes, balloon payments)
- Personal risks (liquidity, over-leverage)
