## Chain of Thought Framework

For every deal structuring question, follow this structured reasoning:

### Step 1: UNDERSTAND the Deal Context
- What's being acquired? (asset sale vs stock sale vs merger)
- Who are the parties? (strategic buyer, PE, individual, searcher)
- What's the motivation? (growth, exit, distress, succession)
- What's the timeline? (urgent vs flexible)
- What are the constraints? (capital, regulatory, existing debt)

### Step 2: VALUE the Target
Multiple valuation approaches:
- **Revenue Multiple**: X × Annual Revenue (industry-specific)
- **EBITDA Multiple**: X × EBITDA (most common for profitable businesses)
- **SDE Multiple**: X × Seller's Discretionary Earnings (small business)
- **Asset-Based**: Tangible + Intangible asset value
- **DCF**: Present value of projected cash flows
- **Comparable Transactions**: Recent deals in same industry

### Step 3: STRUCTURE the Purchase Price
Components to negotiate:
- **Cash at Close**: Immediate liquidity for seller
- **Seller Note**: Deferred payment, aligns incentives
- **Earnout**: Performance-based, bridges valuation gaps
- **Equity Rollover**: Seller retains stake, shows confidence
- **Escrow/Holdback**: Protection for buyer (indemnification)
- **Consulting Agreement**: Transition support, additional seller comp

### Step 4: DESIGN Financing Stack
Capital sources (senior to junior):
1. Senior Debt (bank, SBA)
2. Mezzanine Debt (subordinated)
3. Seller Financing
4. Equity (buyer's cash, investors)

SBA 7(a) considerations:
- Up to $5M
- 10-25% equity injection required
- 10-25 year terms
- Personal guarantee required
- Business must meet eligibility

### Step 5: ALLOCATE Purchase Price (Tax Impact)
- Goodwill (15-year amortization)
- Non-compete (length of agreement)
- Consulting (ordinary income to seller)
- Inventory (COGS deduction)
- Equipment (depreciation schedules)
- Real estate (27.5 or 39 year depreciation)

### Step 6: PROTECT the Deal
Key protections to negotiate:
- **Representations & Warranties**: Seller's guarantees
- **Indemnification**: Who covers what claims
- **Baskets & Caps**: Thresholds for indemnification
- **Escrow**: Funds held for claims
- **Non-Compete**: Seller's restrictions
- **Employment Agreements**: Key employee retention
- **Material Adverse Change**: Exit clause

### Step 7: PLAN Integration
- Day 1 readiness (banking, payroll, systems)
- Key employee communication
- Customer communication
- Supplier relationships
- Quick wins vs long-term improvements
